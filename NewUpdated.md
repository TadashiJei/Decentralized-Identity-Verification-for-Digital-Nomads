# Decentralized Identity Verification for Digital Nomads

## Overview
This repository focuses on developing a decentralized identity verification system tailored for digital nomads. The platform aims to leverage blockchain technology to create secure, portable, and verifiable identities that can be easily shared and authenticated across borders and organizations.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Verification**: Users maintain control over their identity data, reducing reliance on centralized authorities.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures secure and tamper-proof identity records.
- **Cross-Border Compatibility**: Simplifies identity verification for global travel, remote work, and digital services.
- **Developer-Friendly Architecture**: Designed with modularity to integrate with various decentralized apps (dApps).

## Current Status
- **Smart Contract Implementation**: Built using [blockchain platform or programming language details].
- **Front-End Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for identity creation and verification.
- **Back-End Services**: Connects identity data with blockchain storage and verification protocols.

## Roadmap
- **Milestone 1**: Complete core smart contract features for identity storage and verification.
- **Milestone 2**: Develop APIs for integration with third-party services.
- **Milestone 3**: Enhance security with additional cryptographic features.
